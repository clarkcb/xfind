Test file

This is a file to test xsearch, which currently has the following 16 implementations:

1. cljsearch for Clojure
2. cssearch for C#
3. fssearch for F#
4. gosearch for Go
5. hssearch for Haskell
6. javasearch for Java
7. jssearch for JavaScript (Node.js)
8. ktsearch for Kotlin
9. mlsearch for ocaml
10. phpsearch.php for PHP
11. plsearch.pl for Perl
12. pysearch.py for Python
13. rbsearch.rb for Ruby
14. scalasearch for Scala
15. swiftsearch for Swift
16. tssearch for TypeScript


The basic code structure includes these elements:

* FileTypes - helps determine file type (archive, binary or text),
  searchability, etc.
* FileUtil - provides file-related functionality (e.g. get file extension,
  check whether file is hidden)
* Searcher - executes the file search based on the SearchSettings
* SearchOptions - loads option data from XML, generates usage text, builds a
  SearchSettings instance from command line arguments
* SearchResult - encapsulates a single search result
* SearchSettings - encapsulates the search settings, including what
  directories or files to include/exclude, search patterns, lines before or
  after, etc., used by Searcher


Partially done implementations:

* csearch for C
* cppsearch for C++


Other possible implementations:

* adasearch for Ada
* erlsearch for Erlang
* rssearch for Rust


This is the second-to-last line of the test file. The final line is blank.
