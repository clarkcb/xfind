Test file

This is a file to test xsearch, which currently has the following 9 implementations:

1. cljsearch for Clojure
2. cssearch for C#
3. fssearch for F#
4. gosearch for Go
5. hssearch for Haskell
6. javasearch for Java
7. nodesearch for Node.js (JavaScript)
8. pysearch.py for Python
9. rbsearch.rb for Ruby
10. scalasearch for Scala


The basic code structure includes these elements:

* FileTypes - helps determine file type (archive, binary or text),
  searchability, etc.
* FileUtil - provides file-related functionality (e.g. get file extension,
  check whether file is hidden)
* Searcher - executes the file search based on the SearchSettings
* SearchOptions - loads option data from XML, generates usage text, builds a
  SearchSettings instance from command line arguments
* SearchResult - encapsulates a single search result
* SearchSettings - encapsulates the search settings, including what
  directories or files to include/exclude, search patterns, lines before or
  after, etc., used by Searcher


Other possible implementations:

* erlsearch for Erlang
* mlsearch for OCaml
* rssearch for Rust


This is the second-to-last line of the test file. The final line is blank.
