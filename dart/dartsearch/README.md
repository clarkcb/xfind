# dartsearch

`dartsearch` is a dart implementation of the [xsearch](https://github.com/clarkcb/xsearch)
recursive file searching utility. To run the utility on the command line, create a softlink
of the `dartsearch.sh` shell script under the `bin` directory. You can also use the package
as a dependency in another dart package by importing the `dartsearch` package.
