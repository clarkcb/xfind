# dartfind

`dartfind` is a dart implementation of the [xfind](https://github.com/clarkcb/xfind)
recursive file finding utility. To run the utility on the command line, create a softlink
of the `dartfind.sh` shell script under the `bin` directory. You can also use the package
as a dependency in another dart package by importing the `dartfind` package.
